            <p>
                Menstrual disorders include irregular cycles, heavy bleeding and severe cramps that affect daily life.
                Ultrasound and hormone evaluation help identify underlying causes like PCOS or thyroid imbalance.
                Treatment is customized to correct cycle irregularity and reduce discomfort. Nutritional and lifestyle
                counseling support long-term hormonal stability. Medications help regulate the menstrual cycle safely.
                Early diagnosis prevents complications such as anemia and fertility problems. Our goal is restoring
                a healthy, predictable menstrual cycle for overall well-being.

            <p>
                PCOS causes irregular periods, weight gain, acne and hormonal imbalance in many women. Diagnosis involves
                hormonal profiling and pelvic ultrasound. Treatment focuses on restoring ovulation and cycle regularity.
                Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise greatly improve hormonal health. Medications help balance
                insulin levels and regulate periods. Early management prevents long-term risks like diabetes and infertility.
                Continuous monitoring ensures steady improvement and better reproductive outcomes.

                Thyroid disorders can lead to fatigue, weight changes and menstrual problems. BP issues affect pregnancy
                and overall health. We perform detailed hormonal tests and regular BP monitoring. Treatment includes
                safe medications and lifestyle modifications. Early control prevents complications during pregnancy.
                Ongoing follow-up ensures stable health. Proper management restores hormonal balance and improves energy.

                Abnormal discharge may indicate infections, hormonal issues or pelvic conditions. We perform examination
                and necessary lab tests to detect the cause. Treatment includes antibiotics or antifungal medications.
                Hygiene guidance prevents recurrence and irritation. Early care avoids spread to the uterus or tubes.
                Patients receive supportive counseling for comfort and confidence. Our aim is restoring normal, healthy

                Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that cause heavy bleeding, pelvic pain and infertility. Diagnosis is
                done through ultrasound and medical evaluation. Treatment ranges from medication to minimally invasive
                surgery depending on size and symptoms. Managing fibroids early prevents anemia and pregnancy issues.
                Regular monitoring ensures they don’t grow or return. Our treatment focuses on long-term comfort and
                preserving fertility whenever possible.

            <h3>Ovarian Cyst Diagnosis & Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Ovarian cysts can cause pelvic pain, delayed periods and hormonal fluctuations. We use ultrasound to
                evaluate their size and type. Small cysts often resolve with medication and monitoring. Larger or
                painful cysts may require laparoscopy for safe removal. Early treatment avoids complications like
                rupture or torsion. Our care plan protects ovarian function and future fertility.

                Endometriosis causes severe menstrual pain, infertility and chronic pelvic discomfort. Diagnosis requires
                medical history, ultrasound and sometimes laparoscopy. Treatment includes hormonal therapies to reduce
                pain and inflammation. Surgical correction may be needed for severe cases. Early care improves fertility
                chances and reduces long-term complications. We provide continuous support for symptom management and
